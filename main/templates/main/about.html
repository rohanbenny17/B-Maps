    <p class="content">                              As the second most populous country in the world India face a major problem in waste management. As of now there are traditional waste management systems like periodic and routine clearing by the various civic bodies like the municipal corporation. But even though these routine maintenances is carried out we often come across overflowing garbage bins from which the garbage spills on to the streets. The smart city concept is still new in India, although it has received a lot of attention in few years when our present prime minister gave the idea of building 100 smart cities throughout India. Now, with the upcoming large number of smart cities, large numbers of responsibilities are also required to be fulfilled. The prime need of a smart lifestyle begins with cleanliness and cleanliness begins with dustbin. A society will get its waste dispatched properly only if the dustbins are placed well and collected well.It will also show the level of garbage filled in the dustbin, The main problem in the current waste management system in most of the Indian cities is the unhealthy status of dustbins. In this paper we have tried to upgrade trivial and vital component of the urban waste management system, i.e. dustbin. The basic Idea behind project is to implement a smart way of handling the garbage in a smart way which is done by using the IOT protocol for transmitting the dustbin status wirelessly, which can generate email to notify to the concerned person that system is filled with garbage and need to be replaced We have selected the Espresso chip which is a node MCU ESP8266 platform. The ultrasonic sensor will show the level of waste in the garbage ,GPS sensor will help the user to locate the dustbin and also navigate to the dustbin.
